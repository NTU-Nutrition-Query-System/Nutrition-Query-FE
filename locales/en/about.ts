    `Supported by the National Science and Technology Council, this project has developed an interdisciplinary exploration curriculum for secondary school students, centered on biomedical technology related to glucose detection. The current project is titled: Development of an Interdisciplinary STEM Curriculum: Building a Frontend Database for a Journey into Human Glucose Detection. Targeted at junior and senior high school students, the program aims to encourage learners to integrate their previous knowledge in biology, health education, chemistry, and physics, and extend it into the fields of electronics and programming.

    The camp consists of two main parts. The first part explores nutrition and glucose metabolism, using a custom-developed nutrition database for student investigations. The second part focuses on the principles behind Arduino hardware/software and biomedical detection of glucose, including building a glucose meter and conducting concentration experiments. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how food transforms into glucose in the body, and the scientific principles behind glucose monitoring devices.`,
    `This is a one-day, six-hour camp, which may be held during weekends or holidays. If your school finds this camp beneficial to students, we would be happy to visit and present the course details and instruments to your principal and staff.`,
