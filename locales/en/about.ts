    `Supported by the National Science and Technology Council, this project has developed an interdisciplinary exploration curriculum for secondary school students centered on biomedical technology related to glucose detection. The current project title is Interdisciplinary STEM lesson development: Building a nutrition database for an exploratory journey to glucose measurement. Targeted at junior and senior high school students, the program helps learners to integrate previous knowledge in biology, health education, chemistry, and physics, and it helps them learn new skills in electronics and programming. The camp consists of two main parts. The first part explores nutrition and glucose metabolism using a unique nutrition database. The second part focuses on the principles behind Arduino hardware/software and biomedical detection of glucose while building a glucose meter and conducting concentration experiments. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how food is transformed into glucose in the body and the scientific principles behind glucose monitoring devices.`,
