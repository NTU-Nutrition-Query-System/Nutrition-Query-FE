The descriptions of food items in this database are primarily aimed at making them easy for middle school students to understand; therefore, item names are kept as concise as possible.",

However, the weight of the food is calculated as the total weight, including inedible parts. This approach ensures that the information is accessible to younger audiences while maintaining nutritional accuracy.",
